# ðŸ‘¾ Kevin Troude â€” Developer

## About Me

Hey! I'm Kevin Troude â€” a passionate developer.

I graduated from 42 School, where I built solid programming skills in **C, C++, C#, Java and JS/TS**.
I enjoy solving complex problems, writing clean code, and constantly learning new things.
I'm comfortable switching languages or frameworks when the project demands it.

## What I Do

Iâ€™ve worked on various types of projects â€” from **low-level system programming** to **modern web development** â€” and I love turning ideas into reliable, well-crafted software.

Whether itâ€™s digging into memory management in C or building interactive UIs with TypeScript, I always aim to write maintainable and efficient code.

## Letâ€™s Connect

Iâ€™m always open to new collaborations or challenges.  
Wanna give it a try?
