# ğŸ‘¾ My name is Kevin Troude, and Iâ€™m a developer.

I graduated from **42 School**, where I developed strong programming skills in **C, C++, C#, JavaScript, and TypeScript** ğŸš€
Iâ€™m adaptable and can quickly pick up new languages or technologies as needed.

I believe we could create great things together.  
**Wanna give it a try?** ğŸ¤–
